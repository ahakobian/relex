H2A-H2B stabilizes binding of NAP-1 to p300. A cadherin mutant unable to bind PS1 is not cleaved by the PS1/gamma-secretase activity To examine whether PS1 binding to E-cadherin is necessary for the PS1/gamma-secretase cleavage, we used E-cadherin mutant GGG759-761AAA ( Thoreson et al., 2000). Tnfr1 and Tnfr2 bind Tnfα and Tnfβ with similar high equilibrium affinity, but they differ significantly in their Tnfα binding kinetics; Tnfα bound to Tnfr2 is exchanged at a significantly faster rate than when complexed with Tnfr1 (9, 10, 11, 12).
