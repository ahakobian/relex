We reported previously that drebrin inhibits the actin-binding activities of tropomyosin and α-actinin (Ishikawa et al., 1994), both of which are known to stabilize actin filaments by protecting them from severance caused by gelsolin (Ishikawa et al., 1989a,b) and actin-depolymerizing factor (Bernstein and Bamburg, 1982).  When  calmodulin is added, the inhibition of  fascin-actin interaction by  caldesmon and  TM becomes Ca2+ dependent because  Ca2+/calmodulin blocks  actin binding of  caldesmon.  EH domains from Eps15 and Eps15R bind to NPF-containing peptides This led us to investigate if (and to demonstrate that) Foxa2 binds Lim1 and Gsc.  Highly homologous to Pontin52, Reptin52 likewise binds beta-catenin and TBP.  To elucidate the biological significance of NE-dlg-calmodulin interaction in a neuronal cell, we attempted to identify another cellular protein that binds to the region near the calmodulin binding site of NE-dlg by two-hybrid screening using a human brain cDNA library as the prey.  Finally, to confirm the binding of the AP-2 protein to the RB target site of the bcl-2 promoter, gel shift assays were performed in the presence of two specific anti-AP-2 antibodies ( 4).  (C) Adf-1 binds the same regions of TAFII110 and TAFII250 in vivo as it does in vitro.  The sequence PSRPNR is clearly not required for the binding of dynamin I to the SH3 domain of PLC-γ, in agreement with previous results indicating that PLC-γ and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase bind to an amino acid sequence upstream of this region (amino acids 778–795) (15, 36).  TPA directly binds PKC, causing an increase in PKC's affinity for calcium and the stimulation of enzymatic activity.  The MKP-3 EB domain binding to ERK2 was not dependent upon ERK2 phosphorylation in our NMR titration experiments, consistent with the previous study of MKP-3 and ERK2 binding with a GST pulldown assay (Camps et al., 1998 ).  First, endogenous AT3 binds to CBP, p300, and PCAF coactivators and when overexpressed regulates CBP/p300- and PCAF-dependent transcription, indicating that AT3 normally interacts with key transcriptional regulators and therefore is in a position to regulate transcription.  Concomitant with increased GSK3beta activity, relative levels of KLC phosphorylation were increased, and the amount of kinesin-I bound to MBOs was reduced.  To determine whether LIN-7 and LIN-10 can simultaneously bind to LIN-2 to form a ternary complex, we immunoprecipitated the complex with anti-LIN-10 antibodies.  The incomplete WT p50csk inhibition of FN-stimulated signaling events in the FAK1 cells is consistent with studies performed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts where direct FN-stimulated FAK-mediated phosphorylation of Shc can promote Grb2 binding and signaling to ERK2 under conditions of inhibited Src PTK activity (Schlaepfer et al., 1998).  E2Fs bind directly to Rb, p107, and p130, and we have previously shown that these proteins are components of the transcription complexes formed on E2F target promoters in vivo ( 49).  AAK1 localizes to regions active in endocytosis AAK1 binds directly to AP2.  Both these regions of p300/CBP bind to the transactivation domain of Ets-2, whereas the C-terminal region binds only to the DNA binding domain of Ets-2.  The accumulation of DephrindeltaC-term around axons suggests that Dephrin may bind to DEph.  Other cytoskeletal proteins, such as spectrin, do not interfere with ankyrin binding to Tiam1 ( Fig 4A and Fig B, Fig c).  Karyopherin beta2 (Kapbeta2, transportin) binds the M9 sequence of human ribonucleoprotein A1 and mediates its nuclear import.  The relative amount of Ym1 bound by di-GlcN is apparently less in contrast to that bound by heparin.  Inhibin also binds to ActRII through its beta subunit, competes with the binding of activin to ActRII, but fails to form the ActRII SKR2 complex.  The results suggest unanticipated roles for this region in actin binding to myosin, tropomyosin, and possibly troponin.  These results demonstrate that Sp1 and Sp3 can both bind to the Sp1 consensus sequence in the IGF-II promoter.  Characterization of IP4 binding to GST-STII-C2B and GST-STIII-C2Bα-loopβ7-8.  It is noteworthy that GSK-3beta bound to beta-catenin only when FWD1 was co-transfected (Figure 3A, lane 2).  Efficient binding of DDP1 to the dodeca-satellite C strand depends on the length of the DNA substrate.  However, since we previously showed that SRF binding to each of the CArG boxes is mutually exclusive ( 53), it is likely that a single intact CArG box is also sufficient to support bFGF-mediated activation.  Pins nearly completely abolishes the binding between Galphai and Gbeta13F.  Alternatively, auxilin might bind much more weakly to Hsc70 in ADP than ATP.  Hence, we speculated that p140mDia might bind to profilin.  Drosophila CBP acetylates a conserved lysine in the Armadillo-binding domain of Drosophila TCF, which lowers the affinity of Armadillo binding to dTCF ( Waltzer and Bienz, 1998).  Although we observed no trans-interaction between TAG-1 and L1-CAM in our S2 cell aggregation experiment shown in Fig. 2, we considered that a weak trans-interaction between TAG-1 and L1-CAM expressed by two different cells might be responsible for the observed induction of ankyrin binding to L1-CAM.  Comparison of the Kapp values in the absence of agonist versus those in the presence of agonist suggests that CrV binding strongly favors the desensitized conformation of the AChR because this is the conformation stabilized by agonists at equilibrium.  A more pronounced increase in [3] GABA binding to Hydra membranes was apparent in the presence of general anaesthetics ( Fig. 1A).  It  was found to bind to  collagen type I, but  collagen preincubated in a  dot blot assay with  heparin did not bind any longerR to  APP.  poly( dC)-agarose; lane 3, DADA mutant protein bound to poly( dI).  However, not all SM proteins directly bind to syntaxins, and no decrease in Sso1p/2p is observed in Sec1p null mutants in yeast.  Sema3A binds neuropilin-1 and then activates plexin-A1.  NAD(H) binds to dI, and NADP(H) binds to dIII; these two components protrude from the membrane (into the bacterial cytoplasm or mitochondrial matrix).  Black et al. ( 22) propose that Nxt1 binds directly to Crm1 and functions to deliver the export complex to a site on the cytoplasmic side of the NPC.  An oligonucleotide with both GAGAG548 and GAGA558 mutated (55/56 M3) does not bind GAF (lane 5).  This interaction is transient and requires both PIP2 binding to vinculin and activation of the Arp2/3 complex by Rac1.  For Gsb might be able to recognize some Ey binding sites even in the absence of its homeodomain, and binding of Gsb to Ey might depend on both its paired domain and C-terminal portion.  PKA phosphorylation of adducin reduced activity of adducin in association with spectrin-actin complexes and in promoting binding of spectrin to F-actin.  It is hard to imagine how ADF binding to an actin monomer could increase the rate of its thermally driven collision with a filament end.  H2A-H2B stabilizes binding of NAP-1 to p300.  A cadherin mutant unable to bind PS1 is not cleaved by the PS1/gamma-secretase activity To examine whether PS1 binding to E-cadherin is necessary for the PS1/gamma-secretase cleavage, we used E-cadherin mutant GGG759-761AAA ( Thoreson et al., 2000).  Tnfr1 and Tnfr2 bind Tnfα and Tnfβ with similar high equilibrium affinity, but they differ significantly in their Tnfα binding kinetics; Tnfα bound to Tnfr2 is exchanged at a significantly faster rate than when complexed with Tnfr1 (9, 10, 11, 12).  EGF-like rpts, epidermal growth factor-like repeats; L/N rpts, Lin12/Notch repeats; CDC, CDC10/Ankyrin repeats; OPA, Glutamine-rich sequence; Dab, Disabled; Dx, Deltex; Dsh, Dishevelled; H, Hairless (exact binding site is not known).  Apart from nonimmune controls, we studied the c-jun promoter and found no binding of p300 and SAF-A to this site.  Clearly, the demonstration that PS predominantly binds mature Nct additionally questions the existence of the spatial paradox.  The demonstration that Axin binds GSK-3 and beta-catenin and promotes GSK-3 phosphorylation of beta-catenin suggested that Axin might be the target of the dnXgsk-3.  In complex with the drug FK506, FKBP12 binds calcineurin, inhibiting calcineurin's phosphatase activity and thus its ability to activate the transcription factor NF-AT in the T-cell receptor signal transduction pathway ( 170).  Still other mechanisms are likely to be highly receptor-specific: the binding of NHERF to the β2-adrenergic receptor and the binding of Homer to metabotropic glutamate receptors, for example, depend on the presence of precise motifs that are likely to be found in few other heptahelical receptors, although other receptors are likely to contain slightly modified motifs that mediate binding to other specific PDZ or polyproline-binding domains.  Therefore, we examined the binding of Raf-1 to Ras in the Spry cell lines ( 28).  Rapid regulation of Cdk5 activity could occur by increased binding of free p35 to monomeric Cdk5, particularly as the generally low cytoplasmic levels of p35 (30,54) are under strict regulation, with rapid p35 turnover (half-life 20–30 min) controlled by a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (27).  It is clear, however, that only a small fraction of TLN binds PS1 under steady-state conditions (Figure 1E), indicating that the interaction is functional and not structural.  Removal of the last three base pairs of dV has no measurable effect on the overall thermal stability of the lariat, nor, in the absence of the exon, any detectable influence on the DMS modification pattern of that molecule except at position A165 in the ζ receptor motif [in transcripts lacking dV, this base becomes significantly more accessible at saturating concentrations of the 3'dE5 molecule (see Results), which suggests that it could be involved in the cooperative binding of dV and the 5' exon by dI].  Therefore, an initial recruitment of Sp1 may also facilitate the binding of Ets-1.  However, the possibility existed that RBP binding may occlude the TFIID complex, thereby resulting in repression in the wild-type case and relief from repression in the RBP/Sp1 case in which RBP is distanced from the TATA box.  The data presented in this study clearly show that I-DOX binds specifically to TTR amyloid fibrils in tissues from patients with FAP.  Mab-1 inhibited binding of DREF to DRE-P, and Mab-4 supershifted the band with DRE-P ( 23, 33) (Fig. 7B, lanes 1 - 4).  Activation of p53 Sequence-Specific DNA Binding by Acetylation of the p53 C-Terminal Domain.  Despite the fact that the K3 mutation does not abolish ribosome binding, the deleterious effect of this mutation on kinase activity in vivo probably reflects a compound defect in ribosome association and tRNA binding by GCN2.  SMAD-induced transcriptional stimulation is inhibited by an E1A protein that binds p300/CBP but not by an E1A protein unable to bind p300/CBP in two different cell lines treated with TGF-beta.  As expected,  HP1 specifically bound to the  H3 tail peptide methylated at  K9 (Fig.  5B).  These membrane lipids bind to the actin-binding domains of AC ( Yonezawa et al 1991a, Kusano et al 1999) and are capable of inhibiting AC binding to actin in vitro.  After transfection of vectors expressing MUC1 and GSK3beta, 293 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MUC1 and the precipitates were analyzed for binding of MUC1 to beta-catenin.  Binding of Cdc20 and Cdh1 to the APC is differentially regulated.  Thus, the binding of Porc with Wg appears to be necessary for the stimulation of the N-glycosylation of Wg.  Furthermore, it has been shown that GSK-3beta phosphorylates APC and that the phosphorylation enhances the binding of APC to beta-catenin ( 37).  While a highly purified preparation of TFII-I bound to an intact Inr element (Fig. 2B, lane 2), the binding of TFII-I to the mutant Inr probe is nearly abrogated (about fivefold less as revealed by densitometric measurements) (Fig. 2B, lane 5).  Full-length p21, which binds to both Cdk-cyclin and PCNA, effectively inhibits DNA replication (Fig. 7 A), whereas GST control protein is not inhibitory.  To confirm the specificity for interaction between EID-1 and Rb in vivo, we tested the binding of endogenous Rb to wild-type EID-1 versus the C180G mutation in transfected mammalian cells.  None of the mutations affected the binding of APC11 to APC2 (our unpublished data).  Interestingly, we saw strong binding of Gal4 to the GC-rich region, even in the absence of galactose, which agrees with previous work by others, showing that the transcriptional activity of Gal4 is not regulated by its DNA-binding activity but rather by the action of Gal80 and Gal3 (for examples, see references 7 and 31).  Blockade of either VASP binding to ActA ( Smith et al. 1996 ) or Profilin binding to VASP ( Kang et al. 1997 ) impairs Listeria motility, implying a role for Profilin in accelerating the actin-dependent motility.  For example, TFIID, TFII-I, YY1, or the core RNA polymerase II was found to bind to the Inr, thus aiding in the nucleation of the preinitiation complex ( 48).  Specific binding of Sp1 and Smad3 was inhibited with an excess of 100x unlabeled oligonucleotide ( Competitor).  Axin binds to all of DCAP, GSK3 /ZW3, and Arrow/ LRP5.  Given the observation that CRT binds to SL structures with GC-rich stems (7, 16, 24, 27), we searched for the secondary structures with GC-rich stems within the C/EBPα mRNA and found two possible SL organizations containing GC-rich regions within the stem (Fig. ​7B).  Hes6 binds to an Enhancer of Split E box and mediates transcriptional repression Hes6 has been shown to act indirectly by binding other orange domain-containing proteins, rather than by acting as a DNA-binding transcription factor (Bae et al., 2000; Koyano-Nakagawa et al., 2000).  To further investigate a possible role for ESEs in U2AF35-dependent splicing, an experiment was designed to test a critical tenet of the recruitment model for exon enhancer function: SR proteins bound to the enhancer sequence establish protein-protein interactions with U2AF35 that increase the local concentration of the U2AF heterodimer and facilitate U2AF65 binding to the Py tract (13).  Because Ubc9 binds such an NLS sequence, we propose three potential mechanisms for the role of Ubc9 in nuclear import.  The effects of the 3A mutation on arrestin binding to all functional forms of rhodopsin are remarkably uniform and virtually context-independent: the elimination of the hydrophobic element in the C-tail enhances binding (Fig. 7 A).  The Effect of dI2dIII1 Complex Formation on NADH Binding to dI Experiments using equilibrium dialysis (39) and protein fluorescence quenching (11) showed that NADH binds to isolated R. rubrum dI protein with a K d≈ 20 μM.  In contrast,  CC2,  p115 CT (COOH-terminal 75 aa of  p115, which binds to  Giantin and  GM130) and  GM130 NT (NH2-terminal 73 aa of  GM130, which binds  p115) had no effect ( Fig. 2, E and F).  Combining GST-Smad-4 with the probe, however, produced two shifted bands, indicating that the   Hex BRE binds purified  Smad4 but not  Smad1.  hese results indicate that  S14 and  UIP1 could bind  UCH37 specifically in vitro in a C-terminal extension dependent manner.  Note that  cyclin E binds to both forms of  Cdk2, whereas  cyclin A binds only the activated form of  Cdk2.  t was possible that the transcriptional effects presented above resulted from  c-Jun binding the N terminus of  TAFII250 to inhibit its repression of TATA box binding by  TBP.  We propose that this is where  CstF-64 binds to  CstF-77, and this is supported by  in vitro experiments with the  human protein (Y.Takagaki and J.L.Manley, submitted).  Importantly, the binding of  Sp1 and  NF-kappaB1 to the  HIV-5S nucleosomal array causes these same regions to become hypersensitive to  DNase I digestion.  However, it remained to be shown whether  Aos binds directly to  DER.  espite the higher abundance of PTBΔ in the IP pellet (Figure 6B, compare lane 12 to lane 10), no binding of PTBΔ to MSE1-4 RNA could be detected by UV crosslinking, while binding of PTB was clearly and consistently detected (Figure 6B, compare lanes 4 and 6).  It should be noted that  importin alpha binding was strictly dependent on the presence of  importin beta (not shown), as if the  importin alpha/ beta heterodimer would bind  rpL23a only via the  beta subunit.  DREF binds to the DRE sequences in the Dm myb promoter We find that  Ku bound to  one DNA molecule can transfer directly to another DNA molecule when the two DNA molecules have homologous ends containing a minimum of four matched bases.  GST-fusion protein or  GST (5 mug each) were bound to  GT-agarose beads and incubated with 32P-labeled  v-Fms,  c-Fms, and  vc-Fms.  IGFBP-5  was captured by  FHL2 covalently bound to  pre-activated ProteinChip array.  This suggests that, even in the absence of Ca2+,  CEB does not bind GTP.      PDGF mitogenic signaling involves the binding of  PDGF isoforms (AA,  AB, or  BB) to specific high  affinity receptor alpha (or  type A) and  beta (or  type B) subunits ( 3,  13).  A  phosphoprotein of 62-64 kDa was clearly seen in association with  RasGAP upon  ephrin-B1 stimulation, demonstrating that  RasGAP not only binds to  EphB2, but also interacts with other proteins in  ephrin-B1-stimulated cells.  In the first, all four Hox/Exd heterodimers would bind to fkh[250con] in vivo, but the Abd-A/Exd heterodimer acts as a transcriptional repressor, whereas the other Hox/Exd heterodimers act as activators.  Following probing with the anti-wheat  PABP antibodies,  PABP was detected bound to  eIF-4B,  eIF-4F,  eIF-iso4F, and recombinant  eIF-iso4G, but not to  eIF-iso4E or  eIF-4A (Fig.  2 A).  Cytochrome c binds to  Apaf-1 and in the presence of  dATP/ATP promotes assembly of the apoptosome.  Cell,  78, 761-771 [Medline]         ubinfeld, B. , Albert, I. , Porfiri, E. , Fiol, C. , Munemitso, S.  and Polakis, P.    (1996) Binding of  GSK3beta to the  APC-beta-catenin complex and regulation of complex assembly.  These results suggest that  p62 binds noncovalently to  ubiquitin, rather than forming a thioester or an isopeptide bond.  Binding of  Numb PTB domain to  LNX.  Use of this approach showed that  ZAG can bind several different types of  fatty acids, all of which are abundant in  human tissues.  (B)  PlexB binds to  Rac in a  GTP-dependent manner.  The  IL-11-inducible  binding of  Syp to both  gp130 and  JAK2 was shown by reciprocal  immunoprecipitations.  Likewise, in vitro translated full-length Ets-1 did not bind to GST-EtsΔTA (Figure 2A, lanes 4 and 5).  The mutation in the APPKPPR sequence (mPR) abolished the binding of  CIZ to  Cas SH3 (Fig.  3B, lanes 1, 2), strongly suggesting that this sequence was the binding site for  Cas SH3.  In  yeast two hybrid assay, we find that CORD is the only region of  Ci that binds  Cos2 (Fig.  4A).  It is possible, therefore, that, upon the binding of  GRF2 to  Ras, the  DB is exposed to the ubiquitination machinery, resulting in the ubiquitination of  GRF2.  Moreover, we showed that the  binding regions of  ponsin and  vinculin were the region  containing the first and second  SH3 domains and the  proline-rich region, respectively.  Our results suggest a mechanism by which  DM binding to  MHC class II molecules translates into  peptide release via disturbance of key interactions between the peptide and  MHC class II molecule near the  P1 pocket.  To further map the  PR binding motif of  RIZ proteins, truncation mutants of  RIZ1 were generated by  in vitro transcription and translation of various mutant constructs (Fig.  5 A).  To ascertain that  serum antibodies  actually bound to  TBP, and not to its  fusion partner GST, the sera  were tested in control wells coated with  GST in  PBS at a concentration of 1 mug/ml.  PIP2 also binds to  vinculin, which then interacts with  talin.  This is in agreement with those reported by  Seong et al. (1997) in the mapping of antigenic determinants for  Bor56 in which it was found that  human IgM antibody predominantly bound to AD I and AD III regions.  As shown in Fig. 3 B, lane 2, phosphorylated p97 bound to p47.  It has been suggested that  GSK-3beta binding to  Axin affects the  Axin conformation, resulting in a block in  MEKK binding ( 36).  The basic properties of the side chain of lysine 13, together with the observation that ATP protected this residue against modification by pyridoxal phosphate, not only argues for an active-site location for this lysine but also prompts speculation that lysine 13 could stabilize ATP binding because of interaction between the positively charged ϵ-amino group and the negatively charged phosphoryl groups of ATP.  For lanes 1-3,  glutathione agarose-bound  GST or  GST-mHR23B was incubated with  BL21(DE3) lysates expressing  mPng1p and beads were washed and subjected to  SDS/PAGE.  Regions of  TAFII110 and  TAFII250 bind the carboxy terminus of  Adf-1.  The  PH domain, which binds PI(4,5) P2 ( 14,  15), and an amino acid stretch upstream of  PH domain, which can insert into the lipid bilayer ( 16), help the protein to anchor at the membrane.  Procaspase-9 without  cytochrome c had no effect on  dATP binding to  Apaf-1.  Boundary elements that have been well studied in Drosophila include the specialized chromatin sequences (scs and scs՛) flanking the hsp70 genes, Fab-7, Fab-8 and Mcp elements from the Bithorax Complex, and the suppressor of hairy-wing (su(Hw)) binding sites located within the gypsy transposon (reviewed in Bell et al., 2001).  We confirmed using a blot overlay assay that  tomosyn directly bound to  syntaxin-1a.  Finally,  DM stabilizes  class II peptide binding sites against inactivation ( 25,  26).  These proteins are responsible for  cadherin binding to the  actin cytoskeleton and possibly for intracellular signaling ( 39).  ( C) This  PIC binds the Ad origin of DNA replication (the  5' attached TP was omitted for simplification), most likely in a irregular, bent DNA structure.  Indeed, recent data indicates that Bcl-xL can bind to the mammalian CED-4 homologue Apaf-1, at least under some conditions (Hu et al., 1998; Pan et al., 1998).  MT binding to  kinesin induces ~1000-fold stimulation of the basal ATPase rate, owing primarily to accelerated  ADP release ( 16).  ( A),  Annexin V binding by  FACS analysis (apoptotic cells as a %-age of control) ( B), and DNA cleavage (laddering) ( C).  We previously determined that the flanking A nucleotides of the AUUUA motifs in the TNFα ARE were essential for binding of TTP to the TNFα ARE (11).  It has been suggested ( 33) that in  Db this pocket could just as well bind  Ser or an amino acid with a longer side chain and that this is why peptides binding to  Db do not show a stringent requirement for  Ser at  P2.  We suspect that the binding of  Ubc9 to  GR, like that to the GMEBs, is independent of the sumoylation activity of  Ubc9 (Fig.  3 A).  Previous studies have shown that  Nap1 binds  Clb2 and  Gin4, which are required for the proper control of mitotic events [  10,   11 and   12].  All of these results and our results are convergent with those of recent studies reporting that dynamin directly binds regulatory components of the actin cytoskeleton, such as profilin (26), proteins of the syndapin/pacsin/FAP52 family (27-29), and cortactin (30).  The results show that insulin induces an approximate 2-fold increase in the amount of  GTP bound  Ras and  Rheb   (Figure 2A) , with the  fold increase in  GTP bound  Rheb being 1.8  plus-or-minus  0.11  SEM, averaged over three independent experiments.  On the other hand,  fascin inhibits  actin binding of cultured  cell TM, when  caldesmon is absent.  With 100 to 200  M H2O2, the BSO-treated AD cybrids had  HSF-1 DNA binding activity equivalent to the AD cybrids that were not depleted of  glutathione.  Cortactin binds  Arp2/3 complex with micromolar affinity ( 27A) and activates nucleation through  Arp2/3 complex ( 27B,  27C), although maximal activation is weak compared to  WASp/Scar WA.  Sema3A binding to  NP-1/Plex 1 - expressing COS-7 cells is indistinguishable from   NP-1-expressing COS-7 cells at saturating concentrations of ligand (3 nM).  The implication was that negative charge at the  PKA site enhances recognition of the  Dorsal NLS by the  importin complex, and that the  PKA site may be directly involved in  NLS binding by  importin.  Cdc20 also binds to the  APC and presumably activates  Pds1 ubiquitination.  We suggest that  PHO binds to  PREs and, in conjunction with other  unidentified DNA binding proteins, recruits  PcG proteins to the DNA.  In  mammals, however, there has been no evidence that  eIF4G binds  PABP.  We also attempted to examine the  actin-binding ability  of partially phosphorylated  F-rad.  The inhibition of the binding of  c-Myc to  Max is the first case in which  p202a was found to inhibit the dimerization of  transcription factors (Fig.  5).  Attempts to purify shM from the mixture of scallop myosin, shM, and rods by binding of shM and myosin to filamentous actin, coupled with selective displacement of shM, according to the method developed by Cooke and Franks (21), were unsuccessful, because the procedure inactivated the ATPase activity of scallop actomyosin and acto-shM.  A potential mechanism by which  CBP repressed  TCF-mediated transcription of   Ubx was that  CBP-mediated acetylation of  TCF decreased the affinity of  TCF's binding to  Armadillo.  We have found that both  Axin and  Axil bind not only to  GSK-3beta but also to  beta-catenin and that they promote  GSK-3beta-dependent phosphorylation of  beta-catenin ( 11,  12).  The fact that recombinant TSP1 domains of properdin failed to bind to either C3b or sulfatide, whereas polyclonal antibodies raised against the fifth TSP1 module inhibited binding of native human properdin to solidphase C3b or sulfatides may also be due to improper refolding of recombinant proteins.  Although HOXD4 showed stable binding to T6 in our hands (Table I), poor T6 binding was reported for its paralog, HOXB4.  Since  Smad2 and  Smad4 synergize with  FAST2 to induce the   gsc promoter, we sought to determine whether  FAST2 binds directly to the   gsc element and whether it supports formation of a DNA-binding complex with Smads.  Binding of  in vitro synthesized  HOX and  PBX1b to the   PPE.  We tested the ability of Hop to affect SRF binding to preferred serum response element (SRE) binding sites derived from the SM22α or c-fos enhancers by performing EMSA using in vitro transcribed and translated SRF and Hop.  However, because binding of  TPR proteins to the  TPR binding site on  hsp90 is a reversible process, over time, a single receptor.  Using coimmunoprecipitation assays, we have analyzed whether overexpression of GSK-3β or incubation with the GSK-3β inhibitor LiCl would modify the binding efficiency of Notch and RBP-Jκ, and we have not observed any difference (data not shown).  A shows the amino acid comparison of the three  FK506 binding domains of  dFKBP59 with  human FKBP12 and  FKBP12.6.  NF-1 was detected as described for panel B. (D) GR and hSwi/Snf facilitation of binding of NF-1 to MMTV chromatin.  alpha-NAC stabilizes the binding of the  c-Jun homodimer to the  AP-1 site.  Several  TRP channels bind to  calmodulin  [16]  , raising the question as to whether activation of  TRPM5 by Ca2+ occurs through  calmodulin.  NES sequences bind to  CRM1 with different affinities.  Also, we have been unable to observe consistent binding between  Armadillo and  Tsh  in vitro (unpublished results), which suggests that the interaction between the two proteins would not be strong enough to account for  Tsh recruitment.  Numerous putative Rho effectors have been identified; PKN1 (4, 5), Rho-kinase/ROKα/ROCK II (6-8), myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (9), mDia1 (10), citron (11), citron kinase (12), rhophilin, rhotekin (11), Kv1.2 (13), and phospholipase D (14).  Reconstitution of the binding of  alpha-actinin to  VPMs in the presence of  actin stress fibers.  Consistent with this, both the wild-type and  S101A mutant 4E-BP1 proteins were released from  eIF4E in response to insulin, allowing insulin to promote assembly of  eIF4F complexes, observed as increased binding of  eIF4G to  eIF4E (Fig.  2D).  The sequence analysis also indicates that this region may be the target of a complex regulation by a number of other  transcription factors; specifically, two putative  SP1 binding sites exist that flank the  AP-2 core sequence.  Myozenin binds to both α-actinin-2 and -3 but not to itself (Left), whereas α-actinin-2 and -3 both bind to myozenin as well as to themselves (Center and Right).  These dynamic changes in the binding of  PC and  TRX to PREs/REs and promoters of  target genes may point to important transitions necessary for the establishment of the cellular memory mechanism supported by the  PcG and trxG.  Previous studies have shown that  Grb2 binding to  Shc is important for the transmission of integrin-stimulated signals to  ERK2 (Wary  et al., 1996  ; Mainiero  et al., 1997  ; Schlaepfer  et al., 1998  ).  However, unlike  SHC, binding of  Numb PTB domain to  LNX does not require tyrosine phosphorylation.  However, although the armadillo domain is much more accessible, E-cadherin does not bind to phosphorylated β-catenin since the presence of a negative charge makes it difficult to establish the correct ion pairs required for the interaction between these two proteins (lower right).  Here we describe the molecular cloning of a putative molecular  scaffold protein,  JIP3, that binds the protein kinase components of a  JNK signaling module and facilitates  JNK activation in cultured cells.  Gel retardation assay of the binding of TR/RXR heterodimer to the TRE reconstituted into nucleosome in vitro These results suggest that  GSK-3beta,  PKA, and  PP1 bind to  AKAP220 simultaneously and that they form a quaternary complex.  We next used a combinatorial peptide library approach to identify the preferred binding motif of the  SH3 domain of  amphiphysin and its relation to the binding region identified in  dynamin I.  The  EH domain of  POB1 bound directly to  Epsin and  Eps15.  CREB binds to the cAMP response element ( CRE) present in many genes and, when phosphorylated, alters their transcription (Montminy, 1997  ; Shaywitz and Greenberg, 1999  ).  These data suggest that the isolated mSos1  PH domain shows a specific interaction with PI(4,5)P2 and binds weakly to PI(4)P.  However,  CBP binds and acetylates a  lysine in the  beta-catenin interaction domain of  Tcf3, thereby lowering its affinity for  beta-catenin ( Waltzer and Bienz, 1998).  Increased Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation paralleled the time-course of  Grb2 binding to  Shc and activation of  ERK2 in  FAK- cells.  BMP signaling is determined by expression patterns of BMPs, their receptors, and soluble BMP antagonists, such as noggin and follistatin, which directly bind BMPs and prevent functional receptor/ligand interaction (for review, see Cho and Blitz, 1998).  As regards   rabaptin, recent biochemical studies suggest that it may be involved in   regulating  GTP binding to  Rab5, with its effect on in vitro fusion being an   epiphenomenon ( 275).  Based on these observations, we speculated that the C-term might function as an autoinhibitory domain, and that binding of  tRNA to the  HisRS region would overcome this inhibition.  Previous studies have shown that  F-actin binds to the  epidermal growth factor receptor at a site in its cytoplasmic domain similar to a peptide of  profilin ( 56).  Because the  Gin4-septin interaction is cell cycle-dependent, and  Gin4 is bound to the  septins at a time when it is activated, we were interested in determining whether any of the  septins undergo  Gin4-dependent phosphorylation in vivo.  REM-1 motifs appear to differ in their ability to discriminate between the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of RhoA.2 No sequence motifs common to other RhoA effectors have been identified, although the defined Rho-binding regions of Citron, Kinectin, and the ROCKs are all found in regions of extended α-helical coiled-coil structure.  Because binding of  AC and  tropomyosin to  actin filaments is mutually exclusive, the   regulation of this conversion process is extremely important to understand.  Raf-1 binds to  Ras in a  GTP-dependent manner through a  Ras-binding domain (RBD) in the N-terminal region of the  CR1 domain of  Raf.  Studies have also shown that  cyclin D1 can directly bind the  estrogen receptor and enhance transcription of specific genes [ 53].  2 This raised the possibility that, as is the case with the other well characterized  class B scavenger receptor SR-BI,  HDL might bind directly to  CD36.  After incubating  dSlo and  PKAc cotransfected cells with a membrane-permeable form of  PKI, much less  PKAc was detected in  anti-dSlo immunoprecipitates, indicating that  PKI inhibits binding between  dSlo and  PKAc (Fig.  7 B).  Finally,  CBP binds to  RNA helicase A and thereby  RNA polymerase II holoenzyme ( 26,  36) as well as other general  transcription factors, which include TATA-binding protein ( 3,  14) and  TFIIB ( 27).  Binding of GSK3beta to the APC-beta-catenin complex and regulation of complex assembly.  Binding of PC and GAGA Factor at Fab-7 in Drosophila Embryos Binding of p110C with PAK1 in Vivo We analyzed the effect of  PKC phosphorylation on  actin binding activities of  A-fascin and wild-type  r-fascin.  The first lane shows a retardation caused by  CREB binding to the  CRE oligonucleotide in  the absence of the antibody or its competitor oligonucleotide.  It is proposed that binding of cadherins to β-catenin prevents recognition of degradation signals that are exposed in the unstructured cadherin cytoplasmic domain, favoring a cell surface population of catenin-bound cadherins capable of participating in cell adhesion.  The reverse transcriptase binds to the epsilon stem-loop structure near the 5′ end of its own mRNA to facilitate packaging into nucleocapsids and initiation of reverse transcription by a protein-priming mechanism, utilizing a tyrosine located near the amino terminus of the reverse transcriptase itself.  In   this protein complex,  LIN-10 binds to  LIN-2,  LIN-2 binds to  LIN-7, and  LIN-7 binds to  LET-23  RTK.  A,  SH2D1A C42W and  T53I binding to  CD244;  B,  SH2D1A T68I binding to  CD244;  C,  SH2D1A R32Q,  C42W,  T53I, and  T68I binding to  CD84;  D,  SH2D1A R32Q,  C42W,  T53I, and  T68I binding to  CD229.  Thus,  MSL2 and  MSL1 may comprise the chromatin-binding activity of the  MSL complex, or may be the first of the known subunits to assemble at  pre-defined sites.  The membrane-associated pool of  GERp95 was not bound to  Hsp90, although activity of this  chaperone was required for stable association of  GERp95 with the Golgi in normal  rat kidney cells.  Thus,  FLI bound  actin specifically.  No increase in  phosphatase activity was detected upon binding of  ERK2 to a catalytically inactive  MKP3 mutant in which  Cys-293 is substituted by  Ser (C293S) (Fig.  2, A and B).  Amino acids  109 - 295 of  LIN-7 could bind  LIN-2, but amino acids 126 - 295 or the  PDZ  domain of  LIN-7 could not bind  LIN-2 (  Figure 5A).  The major  CRE is bound by  CREB and  CREB is phosphorylated at  serine 133 in response to  PTH treatment (  Pearman et al., 1996).  We here have found that, in ligand overlay assay,  Cupidin could potentially interact with  RhoA,  Rac1, and  Cdc42 in a  GTP-dependent manner through the C-terminal two-thirds homologous to the  Rho binding site of  Citron.  Also, the  VIP1R antagonist blocked the effect of  VIP/ PACAP on both  NF-kB and  c-Jun/ CREB binding to the  TNFalpha promoter, supporting the involvement of the  VIP1R in the regulatory effect of  VIP/ PACAP on  TNFalpha gene expression.  We have identified several amino acids, distinct from the  MIDAS residues, which are critical for  alpha2-I domain binding to  collagen.  Furthermore,  dFOXO binding to the  d4EBP promoter fragment can be efficiently  competed with an  unlabeled 113-bp d4EBP promoter fragment  ( Fig. 5B, lanes 9 - 12)  but not with nonspecific DNA ( Fig.  5B, lanes 13 - 16).  In the absence of a functional Exd half-site, the Hox half-site in fkh[250] weakly binds several Hox proteins, but when the Exd half-site is functional, one of these Hox proteins (Scr) binds better than the others; thus, Exd selectively enhances the binding of one Hox protein over the others.  NC2 binds to  TBP and inhibits its function (Goppelt and Meisterernst, 1996  ; Goppelt  et al., 1996  ).  The acquired thermotolerance may thus result from the higher content of  HSP70 and a subsequent more extensive binding of  HSP70 to  F-actin in the primed cells.  To identify which region of  HP1 binds to the  H4 peptides, we used an rHP1 sample in which the protein had been cleaved into two peptides.  These proteins are components of the  TFIID complex whose binding to the core promoter box is an early step in the assembly of the preinitiation complex (reviewed in   Lemon and Tjian, 2000  ).  For instance, both  antithrombin III and  heparin cofactor II bind heparin, but only  heparin cofactor II binds  DS ( 21).  Evidence of a difference between  Sina and  Phyl affinity for  Ttk binding led us to examine whether  Phyl facilitates interaction of  Sina with  Ttk.  The binding of  Pc to the  BXC and  ANTC, and most other loci was also unaltered in the double mutant, but we found that binding to two specific chromosomal sites was lost ( Fig. 6).  Pnt binds specifically to the   yan enhancer and competes with  Su(H) for DNA binding.  (F) To prevent runaway signaling, a negative feedback loop may occur in which  MAE binds to  PNT-P2 and inhibits transcriptional activation.  To investigate this, we isolated the F-actin binding part of human plasma gelsolin comprising segment 2 and 3 (S2–3) and performed competition experiments under conditions (pH 6.8) where cofilin is known to efficiently bind to F-actin and only causes limited depolymerization (14).  Paradoxically, however, we detected similar quantitative binding between STK15 and PP1 at 8, 9, and 12 h post-thymidine release, despite the fact that STK15 was predominantly seen in active hyperphosphorylated form at 8 and 9 h post-release unlike the hypophosphorylated form detected at 12 h post-release (Fig. 2 A).  Ca2+ could promote synaptotagmin binding to syntaxin/SNAP25 heterodimers, which would bring VAMP on the vesicle into proximity with syntaxin/SNAP25 heterodimers to form ternary SNARE complexes that could initiate fusion (16).  Thus, even though some of the  Galphai overexpression  phenotypes may be caused by depletion of   Gbeta13F, other mechanisms like depletion of another  Gbeta  subunit or signaling via the  GDP-bound form  of  Galphai may contribute to these phenotypes.  Furthermore, the binding of  Abi-1 to  Sos alone is apparently not sufficient to block all signaling to  Erks; for example, overexpression of  Abi-1 fails to abolish  v-Src-induced  Erk activation.  Together, these results support  the notion that  Crk binding to  CAS is critical for the migratory properties of these cells and that the substrate domain of  CAS as well as the  SH2 domain of  Crk contribute  to this response.  However, the 131-1-1 chimera containing the Na region of Smad1 could weakly induce transcription of 3GC2-Lux, but the 13-1-1 and 133-1-1 chimeras failed to do so,2 suggesting that Smad1 may bind to GC-rich sequences in a fashion different from that of Smad3 and that both the Na and the C regions of MH1 may play a role in the direct DNA binding of Smad1.  This agrees with our previous finding that the Q domain is required for efficient binding between Gro and Rpd3 (Fig. ​(Fig.4D)4D) and with our previously published results showing that efficient repression by Gro requires a functional tetramerization domain (Chen et al. 1998).  In the absence of  Wnt signals,  LEF1 binds to transcriptional  co-repressors TLE,  CtBP, and  HDACs to inhibit gene expression ( 22).  However, it did so with lower efficiency than the  COOH-terminal portion of  Eps15 itself, suggesting that, in vivo,  Eps15 binds to  AP2 with higher affinity than with Numb ( Fig 4 D).  In CD44, a.a.1-19 and a.a.1-31 (thick lines, bottom, a) bound to moesin with similar affinity to the whole cytoplasmic domain of CD44 at 40 mM KCl, whereas a.a.19-70 as well as a.a.1-70 showed very low affinity to moesin (broken lines, bottom, a), indicating that a.a.1-19 are responsible for moesin binding of CD44 (Fig. 2) and that a.a.19-70 are inhibitory for moesin binding of CD44.  GAGA factor, which binds the  GAGA element, has been shown to remodel chromatin and may be involved in rendering the DNA in chromatin accessible to the transcriptional machinery ( 41,  45,  46).  The cytoplasmic domain of   cadherin binds to  catenins, which are required for binding  the  cadherin/ catenin complex to the  actin cytoskeleton.  ELP70  binds to  MTs  in vitro.  Overexpression of amphiphysin 1 fragments comprising a functional clathrin binding site provided experimental evidence for the hypothesis that interactions of the NH2-terminal domain of clathrin are crucial for its recruitment and assembly into coated pits.  Fractionation of splicing extracts showed that two fractions associated with  U2 snRNP,  SF3a and  SF3b, are required for the binding of  U2 snRNP to  pre-mRNAs ( 10,  31).  The observations that substitution of serine 195 with both cysteine and alanine inhibit cleavage, and that the mutant ETs still specifically bind Dsg1 (see below), demonstrate that serine 195 is necessary for efficient catalytic cleavage of Dsg1.  Consistent with the data shown in Fig.  1 B,  PP1 binding to  STK15 increased with cell cycle progression to mitosis (Fig.  2 A).  The requirement for the  MADS box for both DNA binding and interaction with  GATA-4 when  SRF is bound to  SREs may impose structural constraints that are not present when the  MADS box is tethered to DNA.  At present, the significance of binding of EB1 and Pin2/TRF1 is unclear, and we can only speculate how expression of the mutant Pin21-316 is able to restore the mitotic spindle checkpoint defect in A-T cells and how Pin2/TRF1 is normally involved in the mitotic spindle checkpoint.  At early time points after activation, newly synthesized cyclin A is also quantitatively bound to cdk2 (see 8 and 12 h after activation of Myc); taken together, both observations suggest that there is not enough p130 in these cells to inhibit quantitatively newly formed cyclin A-cdk2 complexes.  The crystal structure of REGα reveals a 20–30 Å-wide aqueous channel through a donut-shaped heptamer (Knowlton et al., 1997), and electron microscopic images suggest that REG heptamers bind the proteasome with their aqueous channels normal to and centered over the proteasome α subunit ring (Gray et al., 1994).  The structure of the  HP1 chromodomain bound to histone H3  di- or trimethylated at  lysine 9 shows that either peptide fits in a groove and lodges the methyllysine in a hydrophobic pocket (Nielsen et al., 2002   ; Jacobs and Khorasanizadeh, 2002   ).  Binding of  Hh to  Ptc frees  Smo from  Ptc repression, which then goes on to activate downstream  target genes.  These results suggest that at least mammalian  JIP1b and  JIP2 could bind the cytoplasmic domain of  APP, whereas the preferences of  JIP1b and  JIP2 to bind  APP are a little different.  Despite this fact,  WIF-1 binds to  Xwnt-8 and is able to block the late  ventralizing Xwnt-8 pathway.  (H) Direct binding of  Dlt to  Par-6, but not to  aPKC or  Baz.  Binding of  PC and  TRX at  PREs during embryogenesis.  Fig. 1 shows that maximum pNPP hydrolysis is reached at an MKP3 to ERK2 ratio of 1:1, indicating a 1:1 binding stoichiometry between MKP3 and ERK2.  Heparin can modulate laminin polymerization and the heparan sulfates of perlecan can bind to laminin, likely stabilizing the network (reviewed in Yurchenco and O'Rear, 1993).  Affinity analyses indicate  that  ZO-1 binds to  occludin ( 15) and the  Ras target AF-6  ( 47).  Our findings demonstrate several important consequences of GBR-decanoate treatment in rats, namely, 1) elevation of baseline levels of extracellular DA, 2) suppression of methamphetamine-evoked DA release, and 3) reduction in [125I]RTI-55-labeled DAT binding.  DNedd4 binds to  Comm through two of its three  WW domains, which recognize either of two  PY motifs (PPCY or LPSY) in the intracellular domain of  Comm.  Similar to other  DnaJ homologs,  auxilin binds to  Hsc70 via its  J domain and stimulates the ATPase activity of  Hsc70, which then greatly enhances the release of  clathrin from  CCVs   (Ungewickell et al., 1995  ; Holstein et al., 1996  ).  These include interactions involving the  RS domains of specific  SR family proteins, such as  ASF/ SF2, which binds to  purine-rich ESEs, and of  U2AF-35kDa, which binds to the polypyrimidine tract through  U2AF-65kDa ( 37).  Where might  Phyl bind to the  Ttk POZ domain with such specificity?  In contrast,  mutations M3 and  M4 had minimal effects on  Elk-1 binding and phosphorylation by  ERK2 (Fig.  7B, lanes 4 and 5; Fig.  7C,  lanes 5 and 6).  The notable absence of a prominent new  HBP1 binding species further supports the model that  HBP1 DNA binding is not necessary for the transcriptional repression and inhibition of  TCF DNA binding through these specific  LEF/ TCF DNA elements.  However,  HTH showed cooperative DNA binding with  EXD (  Fig. 6B, lane 8) or  PBX1 (data not shown) in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay in which the  DNA (TGATTGAC) contained the binding site for both  EXD (TGAT) and  HTH (TGAC).  According to Chalovich  et al.(1987),  caldesmon acts as a competitive inhibitor of the  binding of  myosin to  actin, because the  COOH-terminal end of  caldesmon  that does not bind to  myosin is able to inhibit  ATP hydrolysis.  In the absence of  molybdate,  ATP is not very effective in promoting  p23 binding by wild  type hsp90.  GST beads bound to a  fusion protein between  GST and TIF2.1 or to  GST alone were incubated with  in vitro translated wild-type or  mutant ERs in the presence of vehicle,  estradiol, or antiestrogens (100 nM) overnight at 4  degrees C.  To  test the hypothesis that  p150   may directly bind to  DIC,  we constructed affinity columns of bacterially expressed  DIC.  The  IAP binding motif of  Omi/ HtrA2 seems to enhance its  ability to cleave  XIAP, because the  Omi/ HtrA2 deltaAVPS was less efficient  in cleaving  XIAP.  These data indicate that  HMG-1 and mAb1C2 compete for the same or overlapping sites and that the  HMG-1 binding to  TBP is stronger than that for mAb1C2 to  TBP.  The fact that GCN2-S577A also dampened the derepression response to 3AT agrees with the idea that this mutation enhances tRNA binding by GCN2, reducing the dependence of kinase activation on elevated levels of uncharged tRNA in amino acid-starved cells.  CSR binding to  B element RNA containing the 1750 mutation.  The measurements of the binding constants of two  TnI inhibitory fragments to  TnC showed that TnI96-116 preferably interacts with the C-lobe of  TnC, whereas its C-terminal extension, TnI96-148, is most tightly bound to the  TnC N-lobe ( 27).  This is particularly likely for the C2A domain-syntaxin 1a interaction, because the chemical shift changes caused by syntaxin 1a binding to the C2A domain are in general small, indicating that few local rearrangements occur in the backbone of the C2A domain at the interacting surface.  The  Ral binding domain of  RalBP1 binds to the  GTP-bound form of  Ral but not to the  GDP-bound form ( 23).  In addition,  Sp4 also prefers binding to a  GC-box, which is similar to both  Sp1 and  Sp3, but not  Sp2 ( 29).  We found that amino- and carboxyl-terminal  truncated forms of  TTP, as well as a 77 amino acid fragment that contained both zinc fingers, could bind to the  TNFalpha ARE in cell-free cross-linking and gel shift assays.  The binding of  raptor to  mTOR is necessary for the  mTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation of  4EBP1 in vitro, and it strongly enhances the  mTOR kinase activity toward  p70alpha.  This conclusion is based on studies carried out with consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide showing that (i) Sp1 binding activity was present in nuclear extracts from all three cell types studied; (ii) Sp1 binding was 2–3-fold greater in nuclear extracts from chondrocytes dedifferentiated into fibroblast-like cells by passage in monolayer culture on plastic substrate than in freshly isolated chondrocytes or in chondrocytes allowed to maintain their phenotype by culture on polyHEMA-coated dishes; (iii) Sp1 binding was specific, since it was competed by unlabeled Sp1 and not by AP1; (iv) Sp1 binding was enhanced by KCl and inhibited by the addition of EDTA; (v) A polyclonal antibody against Sp1 decreased the binding of Sp1 by 85% in chondrocytes dedifferentiated into fibroblast-like cells but caused only a very slight inhibition in freshly isolated chondrocytes or in chondrocytes cultured in suspension on polyHEMA.  The related  MAGUKs SAP90/PSD95,  PSD93/chapsyn-110,  SAP97, and  SAP102 all bound to the  COOH-terminal tail of  PMCA4b, whereas only the first three bound to the tail of  PMCA2b.  Furthermore,  PTB binding downstream of  N1 affects its ability to bind upstream, suggesting that  PTB cooperativity plays a role in repression ( 12).  ( B) Binding of  JNK1 to  GST and  GST-JIP-1 (residues 127 to 281) was examined in the absence and presence of  synthetic peptides (64 mug/ml).  Taking into account the flexibility of the nuclease cutting point (around 4 base pairs from the  Sp1 binding site in the DNA; Ref.  41), it can be concluded that  Sp1 binds the  endoglin promoter at around  33/ 46.  To study binding of the arrestins to the m2 mAChR or β2AR, 200 fmol of the receptor (phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated) were incubated for 50 min at 30°C in a 50-μl reaction with 50 fmol of the respective [3H]arrestin and 100 μM of either the respective antagonist (atropine or alprenolol) or agonist (carbachol or isoproterenol) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM potassium acetate, 0.5 mM MgCl2 (and 0.2 mM dithiothreitol for the mAChR).  The function of the  GUK domain, which lacks kinase activity in the  MAGUK proteins analyzed so far, is not known but has been suggested to be important for binding of  ZO-1 to  occludin ( 5).  This observation demonstrates that  Ubc9 binding to  Mdm2 is under a dynamic regulation and affected by changes elicited upon stress and DNA damage, as shown here for UV irradiation.  Both forms of  Axin bound to endogenous  GSK-3beta in SW480 cells (Fig.  2).  A bacterially expressed POP-1 fragment containing the  HMG domain specifically binds the optimal  Tcf target site, but not a sequence that lacks the  core Tcf target motif ( Fig. 1a).  They considered whether this result might be explained if both  kinesin II and  dynein bound to  dynactin and thereby docked onto membranes.  Combined with the result that GAGA consensus sequence is required in vivo, the genetic results strongly suggest that  GAF binds to the  MCP element and contributes to the maintenance of silencing.  V-ATPase  binding to  actin approaches saturation at 1 mol of   V-ATPase  per 8 mol of  F-actin.  It is hypothesized that  heparin binds to both  PCI and  APC during  PCI-mediated inhibition of  APC, thus guiding the encounter of these proteins via a template mechanism ( 9,  10).  However, as often happens with binding through  SH3 domains, the binding of  CIZ with  Cas persists even after the focal adhesions are destroyed.  Transcription factors which bind to Sp1 and AP1 have been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of other genes involved in lipid metabolism including apoA-II (31), apoC-III (32), chicken vitellogenin II (34), fatty acid synthase (35–37), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (38), the LDL receptor (39), and the LDL receptor related protein (LRP) (40).  Mutational Analysis of BAG4 Binding to Hsc70 GTP binding to  RECQ5/QE is needed for stimulation of the  helicase activity   GTPgammaS neither supported the  helicase reaction itself (Fig.  6, lane 12) nor induced the  DNA helicase activity in the presence of  GTP (Fig.  6, lane 9).  If neuroglian were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in S2 cells, and phosphorylation was responsible for the lack of ankyrin binding to neuroglian at noncontact sites of aggregated S2 cells, then the mutation of tyrosine residue 1234 in Drosophila neuroglian would be expected to cause ankyrin binding indiscriminately at all regions of the plasma membrane.  Binding of  thioflavin-S to  MAP-2 MTBR-123 as well as to MAP-2c was attended by a characteristic fluorescence enhancement previously reported for  thioflavin-S interactions with polymerized  Tau K12 fragment ( 16).  Shank, a novel family of postsynaptic density proteins that binds to the NMDA receptor/PSD-95/GKAP complex and cortactin.  The cytoplasmic tail of  E-cadherin is bound directly to  beta-catenin or  plakoglobin, and thereby to  alpha-catenin and  actin (reviewed in Ref.  2).  The role of  NIK binding to  Nck in  NIK regulation and  NIK activation of the  JNK/ SAPK pathway is most intriguing.  For binding of  GST proteins to  Cdk2 from nuclear extracts, purified  GST proteins were incubated with 50 mug of  Jurkat cell nuclear extract and washed three times with  IP buffer.  Neither the  Vg-Sd complex nor  Sd alone bound to the shorter 18  mer.  Interestingly,  Abl binds to the  proline-rich sequences found in  formin proteins ( Ren  et al., 1993) and to  Ena ( Gertler  et al., 1995), which also bind to  profilin.  The phosphorylated forms of β-catenin bind the F box protein β-TrCP, a subunit of the SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, resulting in ubiquitination of β-catenin and its destruction by the proteasome Jiang and Struhl 1998, Winston et al. 1999, Hart et al. 1999, Kitagawa et al. 1999, Polakis 2001.  Although both sSpi and the C-terminal region including the EGF-like domain of Aos can bind to DER (Fig. 2), Aos and sSpi cannot bind to it simultaneously, suggesting Aos inhibits DER with a mechanism that is similar to that of Ang2 on Tie2/Tek receptor signaling.  The DNA binding activity of TTF-1 in thyroid cells has been reported to be under TSH control because of redox regulation (19) even though TTF-1 mRNA appears to be down-regulated by the hormone (41, 42).  From these data we observed a small increase in the percent of  WT coat protein bound to  GroEL with increasing temperature.  Nevertheless, the binding of  NF1 and  Sp1 to oligo II  in vitro is mutually exclusive as indicated by the results of  DMSA, which is consistent with the lack of additivity in the activation of the  P2 promoter by these two factors  in vivo.  We have shown that full-length  Tsg101 binds  Hrs (and  COOH-terminal fragments), and that  COOH-terminal Hrs fragments can support  Tsg101-dependent plasma membrane vesicle fission in a heterologous  VLP system.  To evaluate cadherin- or TCF-binding capacity of β-catenin in SW480 cells, a cell lysate (1% nonidet 40–containing buffer) or 100,000-g detergent-free supernatant (Reinacher-Schick and Gumbiner 2001) was subjected to consecutive affinity precipitations (30′ incubations × 3) with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of C-cadherin (Yap et al. 1998) or the β-catenin binding region of Xenopus TCF-3.  We may then use the crystal structure model ( 33) of an archael  Cdc6 ortholog as a guide for the  ATP-binding structures of  ORC1.  Although  CD19 function may be elicited following its potential binding to an as yet  unidentified ligand,  C3d binding to  CD21 supplies an already characterized ligand for the  CD19 complex, thereby linking complement activation and  B cell function.  The activation response provided by Dfd-VP16, combined with the same binding properties of Dfd and Dfd-VP16 (see Figure 1B and C), suggests that as in Drosophila embryos, Dfd protein occupies 2×D-binding sites in tissue culture cells, but has no effect on transcription of the adjacent reporter gene.  The latter event also facilitates binding of  dATP (or  ATP) by  Apaf-1, which may lock the molecule into a more open configuration and permit oligomerization and  caspase-9 recruitment.  We reasoned that the homology of the  heparin binding motifs of  apoE and  Abeta revealed by the immunochemical studies was responsible for the competition of  Abeta for the uptake of  apoE-enriched betaVLDL.  On the other hand, CBP/p300 could still function as a “glue” to bring together ER81 and transcription factors binding outside CBP region 451 to 721, such as Fos or nuclear hormone receptors (18), and thereby facilitate cooperation between different classes of transcription factors at selected promoters containing respective DNA-binding sites.  To test whether Ras mutant cells within the dorsal appendage primordia undergo this shape change, we carried out confocal analyses of mosaic egg chambers in which we simultaneously detected Ras clones and visualized cell morphology using one of two reagents: rhodamine-phalloidin, which binds to filamentous actin, or anti-E-cadherin, which highlights apical morphology (Fig. 6A).  The convex shape of the Scatchard plot indicated that  Arg binds to  F-actin with positive cooperativity (Fig.  1 G; ref.  19).  However, our previous overlay experiment showed a direct binding between  dSlo and  PKAc, suggesting a novel channel-PKA protein complex.  SF1/BBP and  U2AF are required for S.pombe complex A and are tightly associated    ammalian SF1/mBBP and  U2AF bind  pre-mRNA at and adjacent to the branch site, respectively, and are required for  U2 recruitment.  The immunoprecipitation analysis of  DER demonstrated that  Aos binds to  DER in living  DER/ S2 cells (Fig.  2A).  The  C-terminal domain of  SAF-A also contains the  RGG-box, involved in binding to RNA ( 35), suggesting that RNA and  p300 binding to  SAF-A are mutually exclusive.  We have identified two regions involved in  RPA binding in the N-terminal sequence of  UNG2 outside the catalytic domain, and the presence of both sites strongly enhances binding of  RPA to  UNG2.  Heme binds to the 70 kDa subunit of  RFABG   Purification of the  Con-A eluate under conditions where the  heme moiety remained bound to  RFABG was accomplished using hydrophobic interaction chromatography.  The Actin-binding Region Is Necessary for Nucleation In Vitro but Not in Cells The results of our study confirm the actin monomer-binding activity of ActA (Lasa et al. 1997; Cicchetti et al. 1999) and extend previous studies by addressing the role of monomer binding in nucleation and motility.  Moreover,  MAb RAK-BrI binds to  RAK antigens p120,  p42, and  p25 in  cancer tissue but only to  gp160 and  gp120 of  HIV-1, which automatically eliminates the possibility of  infection.  It is possible that those ends which exhibit minimal silencing are not bound by an  ORC, or are bound by a different  ORC species that is not competent for repression.  SREs between muscle and nonmuscle gene promoters can be interchanged without loss of their function (9), thus suggesting that in addition of SRF binding to SRE in both types of promoters, its activity is very much governed by other cell type- and promoter-specific factors interacting with SRF.  Phosphorylation of  Y1176 prevents  L1 binding to  AP-2, an adaptor required for  clathrin-mediated internalization of  L1.  The only  transcription factor known to bind to repeat 3 is  Sp1, which binds to the 10  bp sequence ACTCCTCCCC  ( 10) ( 11).  In contrast, while binding of  NCS-1 to  calcineurin was increased at 10  muM Ca2+ it was also detectable at 0 Ca2+.  Perhaps it is another region of  CBP, not the  KIX domain, which is bound to the  CREB complexes after depolarization, or perhaps  CBP binds to another nearby factor, though a stimulatory role for such  CBP binding remains unproven.  As noted before ( 17), the existence of two binding sites in mammalian  eIF4G may result in more stable binding of  eIF4A than for the forms of  eIF4G that only have one such site.  A Wnt signal induces an increase in the cytoplasmic pool of β-catenin which binds to a Tcf protein and localizes the complex to the nucleus where transcription of prospective target genes are activated (Huber et al., 1996).  Actopaxin localizes to focal adhesions and binds  actin in addition to binding  paxillin ( 9).  The triply  mutant protein binds FAD and supports aerotaxis.  The importance of the loop sequence for molecular recognition is also demonstrated by an artificially engineered FnIIID with altered sequences on the BC and FG loops that binds ubiquitin with high affinity (41).  To confirm that  CtIP could directly bind with  CtBP, we carried out  in vitro binding experiments.  Binding of  p53 and   Sp1  to their cognate sites is required for their functional cooperation.  Truncated MDC lost binding to  CCR4, the only characterized receptor for this  chemokine ( 30), although it maintained chemotactic activity likely via interaction with an undefined cell surface molecule ( 22).  Our results show that, while none of the individual  p120  domains bound significant levels of  p190, expression of the entire   SH2/SH3/SH2 region in the (N+C) SH construct mediated  p190 binding.  Furthermore,  Sec5 binds a  Ral protein, which is not present in  yeast ( Brymora  et al., 2001;  Moskalenko  et al., 2002;  Sugihara  et al., 2002).  The first is that the strength of the tubulin-motor interaction partly overrides the coiled-coil interaction within the kinesin dimer, forcing the heads to come apart so that the individual kinesin molecules can bind to different tubulin heterodimers, relieving the constraints imposed by the coiled-coil necks (Thormählen et al., 1998b).  In addition, these studies suggested that Arg175 functions as a phosphorylation-sensitive trigger because charge neutralization enabled an  R175N mutant arrestin to bind to  Rh* as well as wild-type  arrestin binds to  P-Rh*.  JNK binds to an  NH2-terminal region of  ATF2 and  c-Jun and phosphorylates two sites within the  activation domain of each  transcription factor ( 4,  9-11).  The GST-Ena8 P → A fusion protein and wild-type GST-Ena pulled down approximately equivalent amounts of chickadee (Fig. 6), suggesting that distinct amino acids may be important for Ena binding to profilin and the Abl-SH3 domain, despite the overlap observed in some of their putative binding sites.  However, following treatment of  GFP-overexpressing cells with 100 ng/ml  EGF for 2 min, a dramatic increase in  Ras binding to  GST-Raf-1 was observed, indicative of an increase in the cellular levels of the  GTP-bound form of  Ras (Fig.  1 A).  An SLSSL sequence is conserved in the C-terminal region of the 20 amino acid  beta-catenin binding repeats of  APC (Figures  1B and  4A, bottom panel), suggesting that this region of the 20 amino acid repeats can interact with the SLSSL binding region.  From the data described above, we hypothesized that PS1 somehow promotes translocation of the QM protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, inhibits the binding of c-Jun homodimer to TRE, and thereby suppresses transactivation by c-jun.  Binding of the  TBP subunit of  TFIID in the minor groove nucleates assembly of the  pol II transcription machinery for TATA-containing genes ( 25-27).  The  GDP-bound form of  Ral is converted to the  GTP-bound form by  Ral-GDP dissociation stimulator (RalGDS), while the  GTP-bound form is changed to the  GDP-bound form by  Ral GTPase-activating protein (RalGAP) (Feig  et al., 1996  ;  Bos, 1998  ).  The results indicate that binding of  U2AF-65 kDa to the  dsx pre-mRNA is not dependent on the ESE.  We further demonstrated the binding of CF Im to L3 pre-mRNA in the absence of any other protein factor.  These findings suggest that the  actin binding region of  spinophilin contains at least two distinct recognition sites for  actin.  The sites of  PKC phosphorylation appeared to be within the N terminus of  fascin, because the C-terminal  actin binding fragment did not contain 32P radioactivity when phosphorylated  fascin was digested by  trypsin as described above.  Mutagenesis within  CRS1 disrupts both  Pbx1 and  Meis1 binding, as well as binding of endogenous  nuclear proteins.  Binding appeared to be specific, as it was not competed by large amounts of nonspecific competitor RNA, and a precleaved substrate RNA did not bind  CF I.  Newer probes, designated  Raichu-Rac and  Raichu-Cdc42, consist of a  Cdc42 and  Rac binding domain of  PAK,  Rac1, or  Cdc42, a pair of  green fluorescent protein mutants, and a membrane binding  CAAX box of  Ki-Ras.  In the absence of phosphatase inhibitors, ATP was not sufficient to produce a significant mobility shift of the amphiphysins in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and a corresponding inhibition of the binding of dynamin to amphiphysin (Fig. 3C).  GST-X contains a phosphorylation site (-RRPSY-)  for labeling by protein kinase A.  [ - P]- Labeled GST-X was specifically  retained by  GST-p53 but not by  GST bound to  glutathione-Sepharose beads ( Fig. 1 A).  In contrast,  Hsp70 does not bind mature  PKC because phosphorylation of the turn motif directly abolishes binding.  The binding of  cyclin A to  CDC2 (sometimes referred to as  CDK1) or  CDK2 is a  pre-requisite for kinase activity and promotes phosphorylation on Thr161 or Thr160 (for  CDC2 or  CDK2, respectively), by the  CDK-activating kinase (CAK)      [17-21]  .  CD36 binding to the pericellular  matrix glycoprotein,  thrombospondin, may be a more attractive candidate for the modulatory role of  CD36 in cell migration.  Axil bound not only to  GSK-3beta but also to  beta-catenin, and the  GSK-3beta-binding site of  Axil was distinct from the  beta-catenin-binding site.  To test whether Rad9p binds to Rad53p FHA1 or FHA2, protein extracts were prepared from untreated yeast cultures and from cultures treated either with MMS or the UV-mimetic agent 4-nitroquinoline oxide (4-NQO; this drug generates bulky DNA adducts that are repaired mainly by the base excision repair pathway [Siede et al. 1993]).  Another indication that CBP coordinates the transduction of a stimulus to the initiation complex on the PEPCK gene promoter is its susceptibility to the action of E1A, which binds CBP at the E1A binding domain located near the C-terminal of CBP (37).  Binding of native  synaptotagmin I and  AP-2 to the immobilized  fusion proteins was assayed as described in the legend to Fig.  1.  Aczonin binds  profilin, an  actin-binding protein implicated in  actin cytoskeletal dynamics.  The mechanism by which  CBP inhibits  TCF function is not entirely clear, but  CBP has been shown to acetylate a specific  lysine residue in the  armadillo binding domain of  TCF.  On the basis of the previous findings that  p300 binds to  SRC-1 through this region, we speculate that this activation occurred through the interaction of  SRC-1 with  p300.  The products encoded by these constructs have the  dCtBP-binding motif of  Knirps, PMDLSMK, replaced by AAAASMK.  There was no detectable  paxillin bound to  GST alone immobilized on  glutathione beads, indicating that the  pp125FAK and  CAKbeta sequences mediated binding to  paxillin.  An alternative explanation is that DM molecules bind to DR αβ and proteolytic fragments of Ii independently.  Combination of EMSA studies, Sp1/Sp3 overexpression experiments in Drosophila SL-2 cells, and systematic promoter mutagenesis identified enhanced Sp1 and Sp3 binding to two GC-boxes at -73/-66 and -58/-52 as the core mechanism of oxidative stress-triggered VEGF-A transactivation.  Direct Interaction of Axin with Plakoglobin To examine whether Axin binds directly to plakoglobin, GST-plakoglobin (full length) and MBP-rAxin (full length) were purified (Fig.2 B).  Since the binding affinity of  dI for  NADH is ~10-fold greater than that for NAD+ [ 46], the affinity of  dIII for  NADPH in the  E** state (signified ``>>'') is 100-fold greater than that for NADP+ (signified ``>').  The binding of  Raf-1 to  Rb occurs subsequent to mitogen stimulation, and this interaction can be detected only in proliferating cells.  Our data indicate that  Tiam1 binds to  ankyrin (ANK1;   Fig 4 B, a) directly.  In vitro experiments have shown that  Cdc42 binds to the  GBD of  Drf3 in two-hybrid assays and in a  GTP-dependent manner  [11]  .  CEP2 and  CEP5 bind to  Cdc42.  HIP1 and HIP12 Display Differential Binding to F-actin, AP2, and Clathrin p120ctn inhibits  Rho ( Anastasiadis et al., 2000;  Noren et al., 2000), and  cadherin binding to  p120ctn functions as a regulator of adhesion through  Rho GTPases ( Anastasiadis and Reynolds, 2001).  A,  Diva binds to  Apaf-1 as  a competitor of  Bcl-XL.  Binding of  GTP to  eIF5B may be required for it to adopt an active conformation.  Bcr increases binding of  AF-6 to  Ras, and an exchange of  Thr 893 to  Val reduces this interaction.  p62 binds directly to  Arp1.  IL-2 induced DNA binding of  STAT3 and  STAT5 is clearly discernible within 1 min of  exposure to the cytokine and maximal by 10 min (Fig.  1 A).  Emi1 binds Cdh1 and inhibits APCCdh1 activity p140mDia binds to activated  Rho (Watanabe  et al., 1997  ).  p50 cdc37 binds directly to  Raf.
