Other cytoskeletal proteins, such as spectrin, do not interfere with ankyrin binding to Tiam1 ( Fig 4A and Fig B, Fig c).  The relative amount of Ym1 bound by di-GlcN is apparently less in contrast to that bound by heparin.  Inhibin also binds to ActRII through its beta subunit, competes with the binding of activin to ActRII, but fails to form the ActRII SKR2 complex.  The results suggest unanticipated roles for this region in actin binding to myosin, tropomyosin, and possibly troponin. These results demonstrate that Sp1 and Sp3 can both bind to the Sp1 consensus sequence in the IGF-II promoter.  Characterization of IP4 binding to GST-STII-C2B and GST-STIII-C2Bα-loopβ7-8.  It is noteworthy that GSK-3beta bound to beta-catenin only when FWD1 was co-transfected (Figure 3A, lane 2). NAD(H) binds to dI, and NADP(H) binds to dIII; these two components protrude from the membrane (into the bacterial cytoplasm or mitochondrial matrix).  Black et al. ( 22) propose that Nxt1 binds directly to Crm1 and functions to deliver the export complex to a site on the cytoplasmic side of the NPC.  An oligonucleotide with both GAGAG548 and GAGA558 mutated (55/56 M3) does not bind GAF (lane 5).  This interaction is transient and requires both PIP2 binding to vinculin and activation of the Arp2/3 complex by Rac1.
